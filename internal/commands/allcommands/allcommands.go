// Package allcommands imports every command plugin for its registration side
// effect. Import it (blank) from main so all commands self-register.
//
// Adding a command is: create the folder + add one blank import line here.
//
// Note: the ".help" index lists commands in registration order, which the Go
// runtime fixes as lexicographic import-path order (not the source order below),
// so the index is alphabetical by trigger.
